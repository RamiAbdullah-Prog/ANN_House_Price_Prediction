![Project Overview](House_Price_Prediction_Image.jpg)



#### **Introduction:**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various factors like area, quality, and other relevant features. The dataset provided is from the Kaggle competition for house price prediction, and it includes several features such as square footage, number of rooms, and neighborhood details that may influence the house price.

---

#### **Project Objective:**
The objective of this project is to:
- Build a predictive model using a dataset that includes house characteristics such as square footage, neighborhood quality, and other relevant features.
- Identify key factors that significantly impact house prices.
- Provide a machine learning solution to predict house prices for new, unseen data.

---

#### **Dataset:**
The project relies on the **House Price dataset**, which contains the following columns:
- **SalePrice:** The target variable (house price).
- **OverallQual:** Overall material and finish quality.
- **GrLivArea:** Above-ground living area square feet.
- **BsmtFinSF1:** Type 1 finished square footage of the basement.
- **GarageCars:** Size of garage in terms of car capacity.
- **TotalBsmtSF:** Total square feet of basement area.
- **YearBuilt:** Original construction date.
- **Fireplaces:** Number of fireplaces.
- **PoolArea:** Pool area in square feet.
- **LotArea:** Lot size in square feet.
- **Other features**: Various features related to house and lot size, materials, and more.

#### **Methodology:**

1. **Stage 1: Data Exploration (Data Exploration):**
   - Study the general distribution of the data through visualizations like **histograms**, **scatter plots**, and **correlation matrices**.
   - Identify columns with missing values or outliers and understand their relationship with the target variable (**SalePrice**).

2. **Stage 2: Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Handling Missing Values:** Use techniques such as replacing missing values with the **median** (for numerical columns) and **mode** (for categorical columns).
   - **Handling Outliers:** Use the **IQR** method to detect and handle outliers in numerical data.
   - **Feature Selection:** Drop irrelevant columns like `Id`, `MiscVal`, `MoSold`, etc.

3. **Stage 3: Encoding and Scaling:**
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical using **Label Encoding** to ensure that machine learning models can process them.
   - Standardize numerical features using **StandardScaler** to bring all features to a similar scale and improve model performance.

4. **Stage 4: Model Building:**
   - Implement machine learning algorithms to build the predictive model.
   - Train the model on the training dataset and validate its performance using various metrics such as **R² score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

5. **Stage 5: Prediction and Submission:**
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices for the test dataset.
   - Prepare the final submission file with predicted results.

#### **Proposed Models:**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** A deep learning model with multiple layers that can learn complex relationships between the input features and target variable (house price).
- **Linear Regression (optional):** A simple, interpretable model that could be used as a baseline to compare against more complex models like ANN.
- **Random Forest Regression (optional):** An ensemble learning method that works well for predicting house prices, particularly in the presence of nonlinear relationships between features.

#### **Techniques and Tools:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras (for ANN), Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** **Supervised Learning**, **Regression Models**, **Deep Learning** (ANN)

---

#### **Expected Outcomes:**
- The model is expected to achieve a **high accuracy** in predicting house prices, with an R² score of over $85$% and low prediction error.
- The model will provide insights into the most significant factors affecting house prices, such as **square footage**, **overall quality**, and **location**.

---

#### **Challenges:**
- **Missing Data:** Handling missing values effectively is crucial to ensure accurate predictions. The missing data threshold has been set at $80%$ to drop columns with excessive missing values.
- **Outliers:** Outliers can significantly skew predictions, so detecting and handling them appropriately is necessary for model performance.
- **Data Imbalance:** Some house price ranges may have more data points than others, affecting the training process.

---

#### **Expected Results:**
- Deliver a trained model capable of accurately predicting house prices for the given test dataset.
- Analyze and identify key factors influencing house prices such as **GrLivArea**, **OverallQual**, and **LotArea**.

### **Conclusion:**
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various factors related to the house and the surrounding environment. By applying various data processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models (ANN), we aim to create a model that not only predicts house prices accurately but also provides insights into the key features that drive those prices.
